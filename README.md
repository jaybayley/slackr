Slackr is a lightweight jQuery plugin that allows for elements such as divs, images etc to be 'stacked', whilst smoothly animating (or 'sliding'). Hence the name, Slackr.

TODO

The following is my to-do list:

* Provide a better fallback style for non-JS browsers
* Decide how much/little CSS to apply in the JS
* Finish this readme...
